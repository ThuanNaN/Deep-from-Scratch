    Precompute the frequency tensor for complex exponentials (cis) with given dimensions.

    This function calculates a frequency tensor with complex exponentials using the given dimension 'dim'

    The returned tensor contains complex values in complex64 data type.

    Args:

        theta (float, optional): Scaling factor for frequency computation. Defaults to 10000.0.
